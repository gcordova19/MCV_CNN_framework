### Task a)
- [x] Analyze the dataset.
- [x] Calculate the accuracy on train, val, and test sets.
- [x] Evaluate different techniques in the configuration file:
### Task b)
- [x] Fully convolutional networks for semantic segmentation (Long et al. CVPR, 2015)

- [x] Another paper of free choice.
### Task c)
- [x] Select one network from the state of the art (SegnetVGG, DeepLab, ResnetFCN, ...).
- [x] Integrate the new model into the framework.
- [x] Evaluate the new model on CamVid. Train from scratch and/or fine-tune. 
### Task d)
- [x] Set-up a new experiment file to image semantic segmentation on another dataset (Cityscapes, KITTI,  Synthia, ...)

- [x] Use the FCN8 model as before.

### Task e) 
- [x] Boost the performance of your network

### Task f)
