# M5 Project: Scene Understanding for Autonomous Vehicles

The goal of this Modul 5 is to learn the basic concepts and techniques to build deep neural networks to detect, segment and recognize specific objects.
The first part of this module is to recognize the kind of object in a given window. To deal with this goal it is used pre-trained networks and it is designed new architectures in a big dataset. It is supplied an object recognition framework with VGG network

It is used deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, Theano, TensorFlow, Caffe and Keras and basic deep learning methods such as feedforward networks (MLP) and convolutional networks (CNN).
